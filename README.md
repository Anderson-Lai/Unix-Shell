## An implementation of a Unix shell in C

Since this is a unix shell, only gcc and clang are supported, as MSVC does not exist / work well on unix systems <br />
To build the project, run the following commands: <br />

```
cd scripts

./debug.sh (for a debug build)
./release.sh (for a release build)
```
